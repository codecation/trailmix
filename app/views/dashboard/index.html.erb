  Welcome to Trailmix! You're now well on your way to a journaling habit that
  will stick.

  You don't have any entries yet, but you'll be creating one soon.

  <strong>Entries are created using email.</strong> 
  
  We email you to ask how your day was and you just hit reply and start typing.
  Your entries will be saved here automatically.

  Your first email is probably already in your inbox. Try writing just a
  sentence or two at first. It's fine to write more, but even short entries
  will be interesting when you read them later.
