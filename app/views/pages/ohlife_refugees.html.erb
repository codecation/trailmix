<h1>Are you an OhLife refugee? You're safe now.</h1>

<p>
  We loved OhLife and are sad to see it go, so we <strong>built a replacement</strong> with a
  single additional feature: paid plans. We call it Trailmix.
</p>

<p>
  It <strong>works just like OhLife used to</strong>: a daily email asking how your day went, plus
  an old entry chosen at random. Just as simple and beautiful as OhLife, but with
  a business model.
</p>

<p>And, of course, you can <strong>import all your existing OhLife entries</strong>.</p>

<p>
  Your monthly payment ensures we'll never have ads and can justify the work to
  keep things running. No surprise shutdown with minimal notice.
</p>


<p>
  Trailmix costs $8.99/month, but your first 15 days are free. We'll ask you for
  a credit card, but you won't be charged until your 15-day trial is over.
</p>

<p>
  You can sign up now and <strong>restart your journaling</strong> habit like nothing ever
  happened. Trailmix is your new private place to write.
